# ðŸ“Š Wireshark Statistics Overview

Wireshark offers a wide variety of statistics tools that help you analyze network traffic efficiently. These tools provide insights into everything from basic packet counts to advanced protocol behavior and network performance.

## ðŸ”¢ Key Statistical Tools & Their Use Cases

### 1. Capture Packet Properties
Displays session-level details:
- Total packets captured
- Capture duration
- File size
- Interface used

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Helps get an overview of your capture session and validate if traffic was recorded properly.

---

### 2. Resolve Addresses
Translates raw addresses to readable names using DNS and ARP.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Makes traffic analysis easier by replacing raw IPs/MACs with hostnames or device names.

---

### 3. Protocol Hierarchy
Shows the percentage and volume of data for each protocol used.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Useful to identify unexpected protocols or abnormal traffic (e.g., too much FTP in an HTTP network).

---

### 4. Conversations
Displays communication between two devices (IP, MAC, TCP sessions).

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Identify heavy data transfers or pinpoint top talkers in the network.

---

### 5. Endpoints
Lists all unique devices seen in the capture session.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Detect unknown devices on the network or check if a device is generating excessive traffic.

---

### 6. Packet Length Statistics
Breaks down packet size distribution.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Diagnose performance issues or spot unusual packet sizes (e.g., too many tiny or jumbo frames).

---

### 7. I/O Graph
Plots packet activity over time.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Visualize spikes or lulls in traffic, helping correlate events with performance or attacks.

---

### 8. Service Response Time
Measures how long services take to respond after requests.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Identify slow DNS or HTTP response times, useful for performance tuning.

---

### 9. DHCP (BOOTP) Statistics
Shows devices requesting and receiving IPs via DHCP.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Troubleshoot network connectivity or IP assignment issues.

---

### 10. NetPerfMeter Statistics
Monitors performance testing done using the NetPerfMeter tool.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Evaluate network throughput and latency during controlled tests.

---

### 11. ONC-RPC Programs
Tracks RPC communication between systems.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Useful in enterprise and distributed systems using RPC for service communication.

---

### 12. 29West
Used for real-time data distribution and messaging analysis.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Analyze high-frequency messaging systems (like financial apps or live feeds).

---

### 13. ANCP (Access Node Control Protocol)
Used in broadband networks for managing access nodes.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Useful for ISP-level diagnostics and broadband troubleshooting.

---

### 14. BACnet
(Building Automation and Control Network)

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Troubleshoot smart building communication systems like HVAC, lighting, or security.

---

### 15. DNS Statistics
Shows how domain names are resolved.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Analyze DNS request/response delays or identify DNS-related issues.

---

### 16. Flow Graph
Visual representation of packet flow between devices.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Great for forensic analysis or understanding protocol sequences.

---

### 17. HART-IP
Used in industrial networks to monitor sensors and actuators.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Industrial diagnostics for smart devices in manufacturing environments.

---

### 18. Sametime
IBM protocol used for real-time messaging.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Analyze communication in enterprise chat systems using Sametime.

---

### 19. TCP Stream Graphs
Visualizes TCP behavior over time (sequence, RTT, throughput).

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Identify retransmissions, dropped packets, or slow performance over TCP.

---

### 20. UDP Multicast Streams
Monitors broadcast/multicast traffic across devices.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Troubleshoot IPTV, VoIP, or any multicast-based applications.

---

### 21. Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool)
Monitors server availability and redundancy mechanisms.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Ensure high availability across server groups.

---

### 22. SOME/IP
Used in automotive communication networks between ECUs.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Useful in automotive cybersecurity or infotainment system diagnostics.

---

### 23. DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)
Cisco protocol to manage switch trunking.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Analyze VLAN-related communication and negotiate switch-to-switch links.

---

### 24. F5 (Load Balancer)
Monitors load balancer performance and behavior.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Identify distribution patterns or anomalies in traffic routing.

---

### 25. IPv4 & IPv6 Statistics
Breaks down traffic by IP version.

ðŸ’¡ **Use Case**: Ensure proper protocol usage or detect misconfigurations between IPv4 and IPv6.
