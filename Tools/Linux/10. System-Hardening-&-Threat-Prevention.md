# System Hardening & Threat Prevention (Linux Security Essentials)

## 🔐 1. What is System Hardening?
System hardening means reducing the system's attack surface by:
*	Disabling unnecessary services
*	Enforcing strict permissions
*	Configuring secure defaults
*	Monitoring critical files

## 🔧 2. Common Hardening Techniques (Entry-Level Friendly)

| Task                           | Command / Concept                             | Why it matters                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Disable unused services      | `sudo systemctl disable <service>`            | Stops extra services attackers can exploit |
| 🔐 Set password policies       | `/etc/login.defs`, `chage`                    | Prevent weak or expired passwords          |
| 🔍 Monitor file changes        | `aide` or `tripwire`                          | Detect unauthorized changes                |
| 🧱 Enable firewall             | `sudo ufw enable`                             | Controls inbound/outbound traffic          |
| 📵 Disable root login via SSH  | `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` → `PermitRootLogin no` | Prevent remote root attacks                |
| 🧼 Remove unnecessary packages | `sudo apt purge <pkg>`                        | Reduces software vulnerabilities           |
