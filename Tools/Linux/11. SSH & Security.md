# 🛡️ SSH Security, IP Addressing & Network Hardening

---

## ✅ SSH Basics -
* SSH (Secure Shell) is used for secure remote login to servers.
* Default port: 22
* Syntax: ssh user@ip

## 🔒 SSH Hardening Techniques

| Task | Command / Config | Important |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| 🔁 Change default port | Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config → Port 2222 | Prevent automated scans on port 22 |
| ⛔ Disable root login | PermitRootLogin no | Protect from brute-force attacks on root |
| 🔐 Use SSH Keys | ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id | Stronger than passwords |
| 🧱 Restrict IP access | sudo ufw allow from <IP> to any port 22 | Allow SSH only from trusted IPs |

---

### 📓 Always Remember:
* Use sshd_config for all SSH server changes
* Avoid using password authentication on live systems
* Always restart sshd after changes

# 🧪 Mini Lab: "The Secure Gateway" (Lab-5)
🎯 Mission: Harden SSH on your Kali machine (or VM) and connect to it securely.
Steps:
1.	Change SSH port to 2222
2.	Disable root login
3.	Generate an SSH key pair
4.	Add the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
5.	Try logging in from another terminal
6.	Block all other IPs from accessing SSH using ufw
