# 🔐💻 Linux File Hardening

Linux hardening is a technique used to **protect critical data and system files** from unauthorized access or modification. One of the easiest and most powerful ways to do this is using file attributes like immutability.

## 🔐 Basic Commands for File System Monitoring & Hardening

| Command                    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ls -a`                   | Show all files, including hidden ones (those starting with `.`)             |
| `lsattr <filename>`       | View file attributes (like immutability flags)                              |
| `chattr +i <filename>`    | Make a file immutable (cannot be edited or deleted—even by root)            |
| `chattr -i <filename>`    | Remove the immutable attribute                                               |
| `df -h`                   | Show disk usage of all partitions in human-readable format                  |
| `du -sh <foldername>`     | Show the size used by a specific folder                                      |

## 🛠️ Practice Lab: Step-by-Step Commands

```bash
# 1. Create a test file
touch test.txt
echo "Hello" > test.txt

# 2. View file attributes
lsattr test.txt

# 3. Lock the file (make it immutable)
sudo chattr +i test.txt

# 4. Try modifying or deleting (these should fail)
echo "New line" >> test.txt   # You will get a "Permission denied"
rm test.txt                   # You will get "Operation not permitted"

# 5. Confirm it's still locked
lsattr test.txt

# 6. Unlock the file
sudo chattr -i test.txt
lsattr test.txt

# 7. Clean up (delete the unlocked file)
rm test.txt
```

# 🧪 “File Lockdown Mission” (Lab - 4)
🕵️ Role: Linux Security Intern
🎯 Goal: Lock down a file so no one, not even root, can modify or delete it without removing the lock first.

> Hint: Use chattr +i <filename> to make a file completely secure from tampering. This is a powerful technique often used in incident response and system hardening to protect config files or logs from accidental or malicious changes.
