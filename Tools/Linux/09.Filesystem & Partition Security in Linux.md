# 🛡️ Filesystem & Partition Security 
Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide on filesystem and partition security!  
Understanding how Linux handles partitions and mount points is essential for system security and organization. Let's break it down step by step 👇

## 📦 What is a Partition?

A **partition** is like a slice of your hard disk 📂. It divides your disk into separate zones to help:

✅ Contain potential attacks  
✅ Limit log file overflow  
✅ Isolate critical files and directories  

🔒 **Security Tip:** Keeping logs or temporary files on separate partitions prevents a single attack from filling up your entire disk.

## 🔗 What is Mounting?

**Mounting** is the process of making a filesystem accessible by linking it to a directory (called a **mount point**) in your main filesystem.

Think of it like **plugging in a USB drive** — you need to attach it to access the files inside.

### 📁 Example Mount Points:
- `/mnt/` – Temporary mount point
- `/media/` – Often used for external devices

## ⚙️ Essential Mounting Commands

| 🔢 Command        | 📝 Description |
|------------------|----------------|
| `lsblk`          | Lists all block devices and their current mount points. |
| `mount`          | Shows all currently mounted filesystems (physical & virtual). |
| `man mount`      | Displays detailed help and options for mounting devices. |

🧠 **Remember:** Devices are typically mounted under `/mnt` or `/media`.

## 🔌 How to Mount a Device

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/mydrive
```
>Replace sdX1 with your actual device name.

---
## 🔓 How to Unmount a Device
Unmounting safely removes a mounted device from the system.

### ✅ Examples:
```
sudo umount /dev/sdd1       # Unmount by device name
sudo umount /mnt/p1         # Unmount by mount point
```
>🚫 Important: Always unmount before unplugging external devices to avoid data loss!

## 🛡️ Secure Mount Flags (Best Practices)
You can enhance partition security using special mount flags 🔐:

| 🏁 Flag  | 🔒 Purpose                                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `noexec` | Prevents execution of binaries from this partition  |
| `nosuid` | Disables SUID programs that may escalate privileges |
| `nodev`  | Blocks device file creation (e.g., `/dev/null`)     |

### 🧠 Use Case Example:
```bash
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
```

**Your Task:**  
Secure the `/tmp` directory to prevent it from being misused by attackers for executing malicious files.
